# Code Refactor Starter Code
## Your Task

Welcome to this week's Challenge! This is an even-numbered week, so you won't be given any starter code. Instead, you'll create a web application from scratch! This week, you'll build a portfolio page, which you can add to as the course progresses. 

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point can’t be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies. 

With these points in mind, in this Challenge you’ll set yourself up for future success by applying the core skills you've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. You'll get to practice your new skills while creating something that you will use during your job search. It’s a win-win that you'll likely be grateful for in the future!

**Note:** If you don't have enough web applications to showcase at this point, use placeholder images and names. You can change them to real applications as you create them later in the course.

Let’s take a look at what a user story written from the perspective of a hiring manager might look like. As you might remember from your first Challenge, we follow the AS AN / I WANT / SO THAT format. 


## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs:

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```



## Review

You are required to submit BOTH of the following for review:

* The URL of the deployed application.

* The URL of the GitHub repository that contains your code. Give the repository a unique name and include a README file that describes the project.
